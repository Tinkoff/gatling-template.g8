A [Giter8][g8] template for gatling performance test project

How to use

`sbt new TinkoffCreditSystems/gatling-template.g8`

Enter the name of your service in the **name** field.

Enter your domain in the **package** field to form the project structure,
e.g. when the value of the package field is set to "ru.tinkoff.load"
the project structure will be ru/tinkoff/load/

**Parameters "name" and "package" are required**. Leave them default or specify yours.

Ð¡reating a template by tag
----------------
You can create a template for a specific tag, for example like this `sbt new TinkoffCreditSystems/gatling-template.g8 --tag v0.2.4`.

Overriding variable environment
----------------

In **Gatling version 3.4.2**, the **typesafe.config** library was updated, where,
for security reasons, they removed the loading of all variables from ENV into the config.
To override a variable from **simulation.conf** you need:
1. By setting the JVM property `-Dconfig.override_with_env_vars=true`;
2. Pass the variable in the `CONFIG_FORCE_variablesName` format, for example `CONFIG_FORCE_intensity=100`.

More details [here](https://github.com/lightbend/config#optional-system-or-env-variable-overrides).

Known bugs
----------------
At the moment, when working in Windows with using SBT version lower than 1.4.1 there is a problem - the temporary .gitignore file is not deleted. This does not affect project creation.
